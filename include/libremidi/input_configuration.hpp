  //! e.g. since the JACK cycle start, ALSA sequencer queue creation, through AudioHostTime on macOS.
  //! It offers the most precise ordering between events as it's the closest to the real timestamp of
  //! the event as provided by the host API.
  //! If the API does not provide any timing, it will be mapped to SystemMonotonic instead.
  Absolute,

  //! In nanoseconds, as per std::steady_clock::now() or equivalent (raw if possible).
  //! May be less precise than Absolute as timestamping is done within the library,
  //! but is more useful for system-wide synchronization.
  //! Note: depending on the backend, Absolute and SystemMonotonic may be the same.

  //! the beginning of the current cycle's audio buffer
  AudioFrame,

  //! Will call the custom timestamping function provided by the user in the input configuration.
